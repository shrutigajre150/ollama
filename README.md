### Ollama - Omni-Layer Learning Language Acquisition Model 

Ollama is a platform where users can run llms (Large Language Models) locally on their machines.

The Ollama library curates a diverse collection of LLMs, each with unique strengths and sizes. Some example are as follows:

* Llama 3 (8B, 70B)

* Phi-3 (3.8B)

* Mistral (7B)

* Neural Chat (7B)

* Starling (7B)

* Code Llama (7B)

* Llama 2 Uncensored (7B)

* LLaVA (7B

* Gemma (2B, 7B)

* Solar (10.7B)


-- I had run mistral and deepseek-r1 in command prompt on my computer.
